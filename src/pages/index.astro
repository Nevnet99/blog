      <h1>Hey 👋🏻 Welcome to CODECULT.</h1>

        A little background about me, I'm Luke a Frontend developer who dabbles
        in a little bit of everything from backend to devops. I'm currently
        working at <a href="https://www.kroo.com/">Kroo</a> as a Web developer
        building out a design system and working on their website. I currenly
        live in Manchetser in the UK.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently I'm mostly interested in talking about design systems, React
        and JavaScript mostly so expect lots of content about that 🎉
